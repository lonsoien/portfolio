        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For my semester project I was assigned to create a site for a Community Science museum.
            Here we got all information and images forehand, to use and place on the site.
            Here I got to try out my HTML and CSS skills after halv a year of studies.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to make the project a bit more enganging and test my animation skills. 
            I changed the read-more buttons on my home page and added a transition width 1s, to 
            make the design and interaction more appealing and engaging. I also updated the validation form 
            on book tour page and added JS where the user can get an confirmation when the book-now button
            is clicked. I also made some responsive improvements. Specially for mobile screens. 
            I also chose to remove header image for mobile screens, and only have h1 title as header. 
            I also changed some alt text description on images that where better described. 
        </p>
        <h2>What I want to update</h2>
        <p>
            The exhibition pages could be more appealing, and I want to create more exiting functions
            to engage the users to visit the museum. 
            Here more animation could be added, and the layout set up different.
