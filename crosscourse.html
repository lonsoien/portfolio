        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="text">
            My Cross Course Assignment was the first project and first time I created my very own web-page.
            Here I got to test my new learned developer skills with HTML and CSS. 
            The project was about creating a web-page for a clothing company Rainy Days.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
            The structure for the whole project was organized, to make the project more tidy. 
            The major changes for this project was to make the site more responsive and especially 
            for mobile screens. As my responsiveness wasnt up to point this had to be improved on.
            The navigation was changed to make it more suiting for smaller screens. 
            I also resized the images so it would load qiucker. 
            The big image on the Home page and header image on checkout page I chose to display none when
            on smaller screens. 
            I also changed the colors on the buttons and links to black, to make it WCAG compliant, as this needed correction. 
            I made some changes on the checkout page and also added JS to the validation form. 
            As the API on my previous database was deleted, I chose to use 3 different images suitable
            to the product pages to display and give an impression how products will be presented. 
            The Sale page was deleted from the project, as I saw no point of having a permanent Sales Page in the project. 
        </p>
        <h2>What I want to update</h2>
        <p>I want to add JS to the product detail page. 
            When a product is added it will pop in an items count in the shop cart.
            I also want to add a whole function where color, size and price shows when the customer 
            clicks on add-to-cart button.
