        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The project exam for this year was to create a blog-site with my overall HTML,CSS and JS skills.
            Also a wordpress site had to be set up and installed so that I could use the blog post to make
            a API call to my own created blog-site. 
        </p>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
            Here I sadly didnt get enough time to make the updates I wanted. I want to find the solution 
            on how to make my modal to work and also create a carousell with JS. Instead I chose to 
            solve the carousell task with CSS and images. Here we where ment to use the blog posts from the 
            API call so the 4 first blogposts would appear and create a next button funtion where you could see
            the next 4 blogposts. Unfortuneatly my changes didnt work still, so the project didnt get these updates 
            I wanted. I also want to change the time title, so only the date of year, month and day only shows.
            I also want to make the search function to work on the blog post site.
